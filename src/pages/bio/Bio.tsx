							Hi, I'm Tyson, a software engineer originally from Hawai`i and currently living in San
							Diego, California.
						</p>
						<p>
							My passion for effective and efficient solutions that resonates with people extends
							beyond technology. As a naturally analytical and curious person, I am thrilled to be
							in a field where continuous learning and collaborative problem-solving are
							common-place, as these things allow me to pursue my passion of making a positive
							impact through technology. When I'm not immersed in code, you can find me exploring
							diverse interests â€“ from challenging my mind with chess to staying active at the gym
							or enjoying the beach.

						<p>Let's connect and build something extraordinary together!</p>
